### THE DOT PRODUCT OF VECTORS
If $u = \langle a_1,a_2\rangle$ and $v=\langle b_1,b_2\rangle$ are vectors, then theit **dot product**, denoted by $u \cdot v$ is defined by  
<center>$$u \cdot v = a_1b_1+a_2b_2$$</center>

### PROPERTIES OF THE DOT PRODUCT
1. $u \cdot v = v \cdot u$
2. $(cu)\cdot v = c(u \cdot v) = u \cdot (cv)$
3. $(u+v)\cdot w = u\cdot w + v \cdot w$
4. $\mid u\mid^2 = u \cdot u$

### THE DOT PRODUCT THEOREM
If $\theta$ is the angle between two nonzero vectors $u$ and $v$, then  
<center>$$u \cdot v = |u||v|\cos\theta$$</center>

### ANGLE BETWEEN TWO VECTORS
If $\theta$ is the angle between two nonzero vectors $u$ and $v$, then  
<center>$\cos \theta = \frac{u \cdot v}{|u||v|}$</center>

### ORTHOGONAL VECTORS
Two nonzero vectors $u$ and $v$ are perpendicular if and only if $u \cdot v = 0$

### THE COMPONENT OF u ALONG v
The component of $u$ along $v$ (or the scalar projection of $u$ onto $v$) is  
<center>$comp_v u = \frac{u \cdot v}{|v|}$</center>

### THE VECTOR PROJECTION OF u ONTO v
The projection of $u$ onto $v$ is the vector $proj_v u$ given by  
<center>$proj_v u = (\frac{u \cdot v}{|v|^2})v$</center>  
If the vector $u_1$ is resolved into $u_2$, where $u_1$ is parallel to $v$ and $u_2$ is orthogonal to $v$, then  
<center>$u_1 =proj_v u$ and $u_2 = u - proj_v u$</center>

### THE CROSS PRODUCT
If $u = \langle a_1, a_2, a_3\rangle$ and $v = \langle b_1, b_2, b_3\rangle$ are three-dimensional vectors, then the **cross product** of $u$ and $v$ is the vector 
<center> $u \times v = \langle a_2b_3 - a_3b_2, a_3b_1-a_1b_3, a_1b_2-a_2b_1>\rangle$ </center>

### CROSS PRODUCT THEOREM
The vector $u \times v$ is orthogonal (perpendicular) to both $u$ and $v$

### LENGTH OF THE CROSS PRODUCT
If $\theta$ is the angle between $u$ and $v$ (so $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$), then 
<center>$\mid u \times v \mid = \mid u \mid \mid v \mid \sin \theta$</center>
In particular, two nonzero vectors $u$ and $v$ are parallel if and only if 
<center>$u \times v = 0$</center>

### AREA OF A PARALLELOGRAM
The length of the cross product $u \times v$ is the area of the parallelogram determined by $u$ and $v$

### VOLUME OF A PARALLELEPIPED
The volume of the parallelepiped determined by the vectors $u$, $v$ and $w$ is the magnitude of their scalar triple product:
<center>$V = \mid u \cdot (v \times w) \mid$</center>
In particular, if the volume of the parallelepiped is 0, then the vectors $u$, $v$ and $w$ are **coplanar**, that is they lie in the same plane

### PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS FOR A LINE
A line passing throught the point $P(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ and parallel to the vector $v = \langle a,b,c \rangle$ is described by the parametric equations
<center>$x = x_0 +at$</center>
<center>$y = y_0 +bt$</center>
<center>$z = z_0 +ct$</center>
where $t$ is any real number

### EQUATIONS OF A PLANE
The plane containing the point $P(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ and having the normal vector $n = \langle a,b,c \rangle$ is described by the equation
<center>$a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0)=0$</center>
